# GregoryArmstonPracticeFiles

This repository is a minimal workspace for my CS50P practice variations.  
It contains only the alternate versions of exercises where CS50P asks for multiple approaches or where I choose to explore a different solution.

These files are **not** portfolio pieces and **not** official submissions.  
They exist only as a record of my learning process and occasional refactors.

The structure stays intentionally small:

exercise-name/
    version1.py
    version2.py

Only exercises with variations appear here.  
Everything else remains in my main CS50P repository.
