🌿 Gregory Armston Practice Files
A minimal workspace for my CS50P practice variations. This repository contains alternate versions of exercises where CS50P encourages multiple approaches, or where I explore different solutions for deeper understanding. These files are not portfolio pieces and not official submissions — they exist solely as a record of my learning process, experiments, and occasional refactors.

🧠 Structure Philosophy
This workspace is organized by theme and progression. Each file represents a distinct approach, refactor, or experiment. Folder names reflect grouped logic or asset types. The index above mirrors my learning path and is manually curated for clarity.
