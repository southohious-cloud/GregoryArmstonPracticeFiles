# GregoryArmstonPracticeFiles

A minimal workspace for my CS50P practice variations.  
This repository contains alternate versions of exercises where CS50P encourages multiple approaches, or where I explore different solutions for deeper understanding.  
These files are not portfolio pieces and not official submissions — they exist solely as a record of my learning process, experiments, and occasional refactors.

## Current Files — Live Index

### File Index

- [distances.py](distances.py) — calculates distances using simple numeric logic  
- [extensions.py](extensions.py) — maps file extensions to their MIME types  
- [grade.py](grade.py) — converts numeric scores into letter grades  
- [house.py](house.py) — parses names and formats them for output  
- [interpreter.py](interpreter.py) — tiny arithmetic interpreter for basic expressions  
- [letters.py](letters.py) — counts letters in a given string  
- [meal.py](meal.py) — determines meal times based on user input

## Structure Philosophy

This workspace stays intentionally small and variation‑focused:

```
exercise-name/
    version.py
    version_final.py
```

Only exercises with meaningful variations appear here.  
All primary solutions remain in my main CS50P repository.
